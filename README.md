# react-seo-kit

> This kit helps you generate higher SEO score which includes site metadata, Open Graph tags, Twitter Cards, canonical URLs, structured data, and I also have included Breadcrumbs for better Google indexing results and Google Search Console.

> I have used this react components multiple times for both professional and personal projects.

> You can define defaults at the root of your application (e.g., in `App.tsx` or layout) and override metadata on a per-page basis when needed.

> Place the SEO components near the top level of your page or layout, before visual UI elements, to ensure metadata is registered correctly.
