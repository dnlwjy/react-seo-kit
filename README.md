# react-seo-kit

A lightweight collection of SEO utilities for React applications.  
This kit helps you generate higher SEO score wjhic set metadata, Open Graph tags, Twitter Cards, canonical URLs, and structured data — including Breadcrumbs for better indexing and rich search results. I have used this multiple times for both professional and personal projects. 

Built with **TypeScript** and powered by **react-helmet-async**.
